# Home Price Prediction Project

## Overview

The Home Price Prediction project uses a machine learning model to estimate house prices based on location, size, number of bathrooms, and total area. The model is deployed on a Flask server, and a React UI collects user inputs, sends them to the server, receives the predicted price, and displays the result.

## Project Architecture

### Machine Learning Model

- *Dataset*: The model is trained using a dataset containing historical housing data.
- *Key Features*:
  - *Location*: The geographical area or neighborhood where the property is located.
  - *Size*: The number of bedrooms or other relevant size metrics.
  - *Bathrooms*: The number of bathrooms in the property.
  - *Total Area (Sqft)*: The total area of the property in square feet.
  
- *Algorithm*: A regression algorithm (such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree) is used to predict the house price based on these features.
- The model is trained, evaluated, and optimized for accuracy before being deployed in production.

### Flask Server

- *Flask* is used to set up a REST API to handle requests from the UI.
- The API accepts input data (location, size, bathrooms, and total area) from the React frontend.
- The server then passes these inputs to the trained machine learning model, performs the prediction, and sends the predicted price back to the frontend.
- *Routes*: Flask routes are designed to handle GET or POST requests for data transmission between the frontend and backend.

### React UI

- The frontend is built using *React*, providing an interactive user experience.
- *User Input*: Users can input property details such as:
  - Location (dropdown or text input)
  - Size (numeric input)
  - Bathrooms (numeric input)
  - Total Area (Sqft) (numeric input)
  
- On submitting the form, the React app sends the input data to the Flask server via an API call.
- Once the server returns the predicted price, it is displayed to the user in a clean, user-friendly format.

## Workflow

1. *Input Phase*: The user fills out the form with property details such as location, size, number of bathrooms, and total area in square feet.
2. *Data Transmission*: Once the user submits the form, the React app sends the input data to the Flask server via an HTTP POST request.
3. *Prediction Phase*: The Flask server receives the input data, processes it, and passes it to the trained machine learning model. The model generates the estimated home price.
4. *Result Display*: The Flask server sends the predicted price back to the React UI, which displays the result to the user in a clear and simple manner.

## Technologies Used

### Machine Learning:
- *Python* (for model development)
- *Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc. (for model training and evaluation)

### Backend:
- *Flask*: A lightweight web framework in Python used to build the server and API endpoints.
- *Pickle*: For serializing and loading the trained machine learning model.

### Frontend:
- *React*: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
- *Axios/Fetch API*: For making HTTP requests to the Flask server.

### Hosting/Deployment:
- Flask server is deployed on a web service such as *Render*.
- The React application can be deployed on services like *Vercel*.

## Project Flow Diagram

1. *User Input*: React UI → Flask API
2. *API Request*: Flask API receives data → Passes to Machine Learning Model
3. *Prediction*: Model generates price estimate
4. *Response*: Flask API sends prediction back → React UI displays result

## Possible Enhancements

1. *Advanced Feature Engineering*: Incorporating additional features such as year built, property type, amenities, etc., to improve model accuracy.
2. *Data Visualization*: Integrating charts and graphs in the React UI to provide users with a more visual representation of property pricing trends.
3. *User Authentication*: Adding user authentication and storing the history of predicted prices for logged-in users.
4. *Real-Time Updates*: Implementing real-time updates to allow users to get the latest property price predictions as the model improves over time.
